# UnityOscLib
### A simple Open Sound Control (OSC) library for Unity

UnityOscLib is designed to simplify the process of adding [OSC](http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc) capabilities to Unity applications. It builds on the Core OSC C# classes of Jorge Garcia's [UnityOSC library](https://github.com/jorgegarcia/UnityOSC) but simplifies the configuration process through the Unity Inspector or through C# scripting.  

To add OSC support to any Unity application simply add the `OSCManagers` prefab to the game heirarchy and configure as needed. This prefab includes scripts for both sending OSC messages, as well as, receiving OSC messages.  More details on each script are below.

To see an example of UnityOscLib in action, open the `TestScene` in the Examples folder and review the `OSCManagers GameObject`.  Attached to this `GameObject` is a script called `OscTests` that show the use of the library.

UnityOscLib was built to support the new [OSC-XR toolkit](https://github.com/fortjohnson/osc-xr) for building immersive music control environments.

Developed and Tested on Unity 2018.3.2f1
